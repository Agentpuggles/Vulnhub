# 🧠 VulnHub Write-Ups

Welcome to my VulnHub write-ups repository!  
This repo documents my progress through various VulnHub virtual machines as part of my cybersecurity learning. Each write-up includes detailed notes, steps taken, and lessons learned while solving the VM.

> 🧩 VulnHub offers offline, fun machines that aren't that realistic but are great for practising ethical hacking skills nonetheless.
